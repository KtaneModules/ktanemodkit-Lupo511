  title: Multiple Bombs
  description: "What's better than a bomb? Two bombs! Take your multitasking skills
    to a new level by defusing two independent bombs at the same time! Two separate
    serials, two separate widget collections, two separate timers, and more!\r\nYou
    can easily change the mod settings from an option in the Free Play menu.\r\nAlso,
    it can work together with custom bomb casings and custom gameplay rooms, so that
    you can have total control over customization!\r\n\r\n[h1]For mod developers[/h1]\r\n[u]Gameplay
    Rooms[/u]\r\nIf you're making a gameplay room and you want to customize the spawns
    of all the bombs, you can do so by simply creating empty gameobjects following
    the naming scheme specified below at the position and rotation where you want
    the bombs to spawn.\r\nThe objects must be named:\r\n[code]MultipleBombs_Spawn_X[/code]\r\nwhere
    [i]X[/i] is the index of the bomb that spawn is for (starting from 0).\r\nImportant
    note: if the bomb count is set to 1, the default bomb spawn is going to be used,
    while the MultipleBombs spawns are going to be used when the bomb count is 2 or
    greater. This allows you (if you want) to specify a different bomb spawn if the
    bomb is just a single one.\r\n\r\n[u]Modules[/u]\r\nThe mod adds special widget
    queries that let you get information on its state. The queries you can use are
    the following:\r\n[b]Query Key:[/b] [i]MultipleBombs[/i]\r\n[list]\r\n[*][b]Query
    Info:[/b] None (empty string)\r\nRetuns a string serialized JSON object containing
    the following fields:\r\n[list]\r\n[*][i]bombCount[/i]: an integer representing
    the current number of bombs.\r\n[/list]\r\n[/list]\r\nIf you don't get a response
    from these queries it means that the mod is not installed, and therefore you can
    assume the default vanilla values.\r\n\r\n[u]Missions[/u]\r\nThe mod allows you
    to create custom missions with multiple bombs. To do that, add a new component
    pool to your mission with nothing but the following mod type:\r\n[code]Multiple
    Bombs[/code]\r\n(space included). Then set the count of this component pool to
    the number of extra bombs you want the mission to have (e.g. if you set the count
    to 1 the mission will have two bombs).\r\nIf you create multiple component pools
    like that, the number of extra bombs the mission will have will be the sum of
    all of them.\r\n\n[u]Mod API[/u]\nThe mod exposes a public API that can be used
    by other mods to interoperate with it.\nThe API is exposed through a GameObject
    named [i]MultipleBombs_Info[/i] that has an [i]IDicionary<string, object>[/i]
    component. This IDictionary contains keys and values (in this text also called
    properties) that allow for interoperation with the mod. The full set of keys is
    described in the table below.\nIf the GameObject does not exist it means that
    the Multiple Bombs mod is not installed.\nPlease note that the IDictionary is
    delcared with a generic value type of [i]object[/i] to allow each property to
    have their own types. The type of each property is detailed in the properties
    table. Make sure to cast the values to the right type and to pass objects of the
    right type when setting properties.\nAvailable properties:\n[table]\n[tr][th]Key[/th][th]Type[/th][th]Can
    Set[/th][th]Description[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td]CurrentMaximumBombCount[/td][td]int[/td][td]False[/td][td]Gets
    the maximum bomb count allowed by the currently installed Gameplay Rooms.[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]CurrentFreePlayBombCount[/td][td]int[/td][td]True[/td][td]Gets
    or sets the current bomb count in the Free Play settings.\nNote: This can only
    be set while in the Setup state.[/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\nAPI usage example:\n[code]\n//Example
    method that uses the API to get the current maximum number of bombs\npublic int
    GetCurrentMaximumBombs()\n{\n\tGameObject multipleBombsAPIGameObject = GameObject.Find(\"MultipleBombs_Info\");\n\tif(multipleBombsAPIGameObject
    == null) //If the Multiple Bombs mod is not installed\n\t\treturn 1;\n\tIDictionary<string,
    object> multipleBombsAPI = multipleBombsAPIGameObject.GetComponent<IDictionary<string,
    object>>();\n\treturn (int)multipleBombsAPI[\"CurrentMaximumBombCount\"];\n}\n[/code]"
